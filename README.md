# Noto Cloud

Noto Cloud is adopting an open-core model to ensure the project's long-term sustainability.

Noto offers two deployment options:
- Noto Managed Cloud: AWS-hosted instances fully deployed and managed by the Noto team
- Noto Self-hosted Cloud: Configurable services you can deploy on your own infrastructure

The codebase behind these two setups is a closed-source fork of this open-source codebase: https://github.com/noto-space/noto-cloud, combined with our proprietary code. 
The commercial fork is distributed solely under our commercial license ([link](https://github.com/noto-space/noto-selfhost-commercial/blob/main/SELF_HOST_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md)). 


**Noto Self-hosted Cloud is designed for teams and enterprises that want data control and modular, configurable components tailored to their own infrastructure.** 
It comes with a Free tier suitable for **experienced IT professionals to test out our self-hosted solution** and allows seamless upgrades to higher tiers.

The Free tier offers:
- One user seat (per instance)
- Noto Web App (your hosted Noto.com/app)
- Up to 3 guest editors who can be added to your selected Noto pages and collaborate with you in real time
- Publish pages
- Unlimited workspaces

You can find the pricing details by visiting [this page](https://noto.space/docs/Self-hosted-Plans-and-Pricing), or your self-hosted admin panel, or our official website ([link](https://noto.space/pricing)).

Open source vs Open core:

As Noto Cloud is adopting an open-core model, Noto Web and Noto Flutter will remain open source.
As part of the transition, we are consolidating and reorganizing our codebases in private repositories.
Recently, we merged all Noto Web–related development from our private repository back into the public one. You can check the [commit](https://github.com/noto-space/noto-web/commits/main/) for reference. We will also merge Flutter code back into [this](https://github.com/noto-space/noto) public repository at a later stage.

Noto Cloud will continue to follow the open-core model for business reasons.
You're free to use https://github.com/noto-space/noto-cloud governed by its license.

We also have a few other open source repos, such as

- [Noto Website](https://github.com/Noto-IO/Noto-Website) for developers who want to build their own website following our navigation structure
- [Noto-editor](https://github.com/Noto-IO/Noto-editor) for Flutter developers to build their own apps
- [Noto-board](https://github.com/Noto-IO/Noto-board) for Flutter developers to build their own apps
